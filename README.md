[I wrote this code in most efficient way better than everyone in my class]

A MATLAB program is needed to filter out low-energy signals from two different audio recordings containing both bird chirping and dog barking. By analyzing energy levels, the program should separate the dominant sound in each fileâ€”one containing only dog barking and the other only bird chirping. 

The code and report are given in the main branch.
